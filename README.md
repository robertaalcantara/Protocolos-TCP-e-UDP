# Protocolos-TCP-e-UDP

Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC) and [@robertaalcantara](https://github.com/robertaalcantara) in pair programming in 2022.

This project was an assignment for the Computer Networks class we took in our 4th year of Computer Science.

Developed using Python, it sends a 100 MB file from server to host and compares the efficiency of different communication protocols and packet sizes.

Packet sizes used were 100 B, 500 B and 1000 B, with the protocols analyzed being TCP, UDP and UDP with RDT (Reliable Data Transfer).
